MVC Database Connection (using Prototype 2 Template)
====================================================

By William Read
===============

This tutorial is using the MVC framework template I have set up for all other coding elements.
Please message me for help understanding the following tutorial, if you come across any issues.

1) Navigate to Modal/Database.php, here you will need to change the values to match your localhost database.
   below is an example of what the result should be:
   
   '''
   $this->servername = "localhost";
   $this->username = "your_username";
   $this->password = "your_password";
   $this->database = "your_database_schema";
   '''
   
   Make sure to replace Username, Password and Database with your values.
   
2) Next, within your Controller create include an instance of the database for a particular class this can either be
   done in the __construct or index function. This is so to prevent any database errors.
   
   '''
   $conn = new dbConnect;
   $this->dbConn = $conn->connect();
   '''
   
3) Finally when connecting to your modal make sure to pass as a parameter to the called function of the model this
   instance so as to allow you to perform queries its contents.
   
   Example of Modal Function (found in Modal/Login.php)
   ====================================================
   '''
   function checkMem($conn, $return) {
       $sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE userId=".$_POST['inputId'];
       $result = $conn->query($sql);
       return result
   }
   '''
